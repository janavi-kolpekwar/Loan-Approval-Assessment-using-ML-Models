# Loan-Approval-Assessment-using-ML-Models
This Python program evaluates the randomized Loan Approval Dataset using Data Mining &amp; Machine Learning Algorithms. A series of Data Mining and Machine Learning algorithm techniques were used to identify which feature highly influences decision making for whether an individual is eligble for loan approval. ML Models implemeneted include Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classification, SVM and KNN model techniques to evaluate the testing and training sets. Post a series of Data Mining techniques (Correlation Matrix & Normalization Scaling) and comparisons drawn between ML model accuracy scores, the most highly influential feature concluded is Credit History with Logistic Regression being the best fitted ML model.
